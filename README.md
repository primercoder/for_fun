# for_fun
Just simple projects for fun in my leisure time.

The source code is very easy

You can run it on windows system with most of the compilers, and mine is Visual Studio.

Or you can download the .exe file, it is the release version so that you can run it without any environment.

It is a command line based game without graphic interface.
